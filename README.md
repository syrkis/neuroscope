# Deep Image Reconstruction From Human Brain Activity 

This project aims to develop a deep learning-based approach for reconstructing images from human brain activity. The ultimate goal is to enable a direct communication channel between the brain and a computer, allowing individuals to express their thoughts and mental images through visual outputs.
