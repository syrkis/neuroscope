## Abstract

## Introduction

## Literature Review
Decoding images from brain activity is a well studied problem in the field of
neuroscience. The first successful decoding of images from brain activity was
done by @haxby_distributed_2001. Like the current project, Haxby et al. used fMRI data.
Most recently @lin_mind_2022 used a deep neural network to decode images from brain activity.


## Data
The data used in this project is derived from the Natural Scenes Dataset @allen_massive_2022.
The dataset consists of 73,000 images of natural scences and various
assoicated responses, collected over the course of one year from 8 subjects.
Specifically, the data used in this project is from the Algonauts Project @gifford_algonauts_2023.
Associated with each subject are region of interest (ROI) masks.
These masks are used to extract the fMRI data from the images,
at specific locations in the brain.
